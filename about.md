<!-- # About Me -->

I'm a researcher and engineer who works at the intersection of optimization theory and practical systems. I develop scalable algorithms for complex decision-making problems and build production systems that actually work in the real world.

## What I Do

My work focuses on **optimization under uncertainty** - developing rigorous mathematical methods that provide provable guarantees while scaling to real-world problem sizes. I care deeply about understanding complex systems, breaking them down into their constituent parts, and developing strategies to meaningfully control them.

I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I worked on risk-sensitive optimization for power networks. My research developed decomposition-based algorithms that achieved 20-30x speedups over traditional approaches, forming the technical foundation for my advisor's NSF CAREER award. This work resulted in publications in the *Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications* and *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*.

Since graduating, I've applied optimization and machine learning methods across multiple domains - power systems, logistics, and commodities trading. At Terminal49, I designed and deployed their first container ETA prediction model. At Equinor, I built risk-aware portfolio optimization algorithms for power trading. Throughout this work, I've learned that the value lies not just in finding optimal solutions, but in building reliable systems that handle real-world complexity.

## Research Interests

I'm particularly interested in problems where **mathematical rigor meets practical impact**:

- Large-scale optimization algorithms with provable guarantees
- Statistical methods for uncertainty quantification in high-stakes systems
- Risk-sensitive decision-making under uncertainty
- Scalable computational methods for complex systems
- Open-source scientific software and tools

Going forward, I'm excited about applying these methods to domains where reliability and accessibility matter - systems that improve how essential services are delivered and ensure equitable access to fundamental resources.

## Technical Approach

I believe the most interesting problems live at the boundary between theory and practice. I develop algorithms with formal properties (convergence guarantees, complexity bounds, statistical validity) and implement them in systems that work at scale. This means thinking carefully about:

- **Mathematical foundations** - What can we prove about our methods?
- **Computational efficiency** - How do we make this tractable for real problem sizes?
- **Practical robustness** - How does this handle messy, real-world data?
- **System design** - How do we build tools that others can actually use?

I'm comfortable working across multiple levels of abstraction - from theoretical analysis to production deployment - and I value making methods accessible through open-source implementations.

## What I Believe

I believe in the value of rigorous thinking - both in technical work and in understanding society. Breaking down complex systems (whether mathematical or social) into their constituent parts helps us understand how they work and how we might improve them.

I believe that **good ideas should be accessible**. This drives my interest in open-source software, clear communication, and teaching - making powerful methods available to everyone, not just those with insider knowledge.
