  description: A set of algorithms to evaluate the quantity of solar capacity that
    a network can feasibly support without introducing instabilities, known formally
    as the solar hosting capacity. This includes an algorithm to evaluate the maximal
    solar hosting capacity and a dynamic method of identifying the set of feasible
    solar hosting capacities.

  description: Power systems simulations in academic work are frequently solved using
    the MATPOWER package. The package provides MATLAB and Octave M-files in order
    to solve power flow, continuation power flow and optimal power flow problems.
    The goal of the Phasor package is remove the need for MATLAB or Octave while providing
    access to the wide array of existing MATPOWER case files.
