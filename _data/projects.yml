- title: RSHC
  description: "A set of algorithms to evaluate the quantity of solar capacity that a network can feasibly support without introducing instabilities, known formally as the solar hosting capacity. This includes an algorithm to evaluate the maximal solar hosting capacity and a dynamic method of identifying the set of feasible solar hosting capacities."

- title: PhasorPy
  description: "Power systems simulations in academic work are frequently solved using the MATPOWER package. The package provides MATLAB and Octave M-files in order to solve power flow, continuation power flow and optimal power flow problems. The goal of the Phasor package is remove the need for MATLAB or Octave while providing access to the wide array of existing MATPOWER case files."
